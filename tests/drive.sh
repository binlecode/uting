# Drive the TUI in a real terminal, then ALWAYS clean up after it.
#
# This is a DRIVER, not a test: it asserts nothing about layout and reports no checks. It
# exists because four mechanical facts have to be got right every single time, and prose
# telling a human or an agent to get them right is a runner nobody executes reliably:
#
#   1. `uting` refuses a non-TTY (exit 1), so it cannot be run from a pipe or a Bash tool
#      call. tmux is the terminal.
#   2. The pane size must be set AT SESSION CREATION (-x/-y). LINES/COLUMNS do nothing — the
#      TUI reads the real ioctl via `stty size </dev/tty` (shell/uting:648), so a harness
#      that skips TIOCSWINSZ gets a 0x0 terminal and a one-row list whose frames still look
#      plausible enough to trust.
#   3. `Enter` starts mpv DETACHED, in its own process group. Killing the tmux session does
#      not stop it; the audio keeps playing after everything else is gone. This script's
#      EXIT trap is the whole reason it exists.
#   4. That trap's reach is the state dir, so the state dir has to be this run's own — see
#      the isolation block below. Reaping unconditionally is only safe once nothing else
#      lives there.
#
# The keymap it can send lives in README.md (Keys) and the YT_* knobs in
# AS-BUILT-cli-contract.md「配置面」 — this file restates neither.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 (macOS system bash). Needs tmux; jq only for the cleanup report.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/drive.sh                                  100x30, default query, dump the frame
#   tests/drive.sh -x 62 -y 20                      a narrower geometry
#   tests/drive.sh -q '周杰伦'                       another query (exercises CJK widths)
#   tests/drive.sh -k 'i'                           send keys after the list is ready
#   tests/drive.sh -k 'Enter' -w Playing            send Enter, wait for the banner
#   tests/drive.sh -i                               leave it up and ATTACH (interactive)
#   YT_ASCII=1 tests/drive.sh                       any YT_* var is passed through
# Exit: 0 = reached a ready frame and cleaned up; 1 = never got a frame, or orphans remained.

# whose state it lands on changes — and their playlists and history still render, because
# UT_STATE_DIR is deliberately NOT redirected (a frame captured here should show the store a
# human sees). What is suppressed is that store's WRITE side, via UT_HISTORY=0 in the pane: a
# track this script starts and reaps a second later is not a listening, and unlike a player, a
# log is not something --stop takes back.

# not a preference), and `-k t`/`-k l` are exactly the keys that would rewrite the developer's
# file as a side effect of driving a frame. Copied rather than left empty because the read

# The suite's own knobs are forwarded EXPLICITLY, not inherited. A new tmux session does not
# get this shell's environment: it gets the tmux SERVER's, and the server is whichever one is
# already running — often started hours ago from another window. `YT_ASCII=1 tests/drive.sh`
# looked like it worked only when no server was up yet; with one up it silently drove the
# default. Verified by driving UT_STATE_DIR: the pane reported an empty store while the same
# variable listed four playlists outside tmux.
#
# YT_SYNC=0 (tmux and DCS frame sync do not mix), TMPDIR and UT_CONFIG are placed AFTER the
# forwarded block so the driver's own choice wins over an inherited one — TMPDIR because the
# isolation above is not negotiable, and it is not a YT_*/UT_* name so it is never forwarded
# anyway; UT_CONFIG because a forwarded one would put the pane's writes back on the real file,
# which is the one thing the copy above exists to prevent. An exported UT_CONFIG is still
# honoured where it can do no harm: it picks WHICH file gets copied.
# UT_HISTORY=0 goes BEFORE it: suppressing the log write is a default, not a rule, so
# `UT_HISTORY=1 tests/drive.sh -k Enter` still drives the writing path.

# SETTLE BEFORE PHOTOGRAPHING — wait until the frame STOPS CHANGING, on every path that
# reaches the capture. This used to be a fixed 0.6s on the one path that waits for nothing,
# which is the path least likely to need it.
#
# Waiting on a marker does not remove the need; it CONCENTRATES it. The capture that matches
# a marker is, by definition, the first one to see the new frame's TOP — so it is biased to
# land inside that frame's paint rather than after it, and polling faster or slower does not
# move the bias. A frame torn that way does not look torn, which is what makes it expensive:
# the top is the view you asked for and the bottom is the view you left, so it reads as a
# renderer that forgot to erase. It is not. `uting` repaints in place — every line erases its
# own tail and the render ends on \033[J (shell/uting:3832).
#
# THE NUMBER THIS IS SIZED AGAINST, measured 2026-08-30 at 100x30 by sampling the pane every
# 0.1s from the keypress: `i` on a row with 28 chapters spends 2.7s on the fetch (the spinner,
# changing every ~0.1s), writes the frame's head at 2.76s, then goes QUIET before writing the
# rest. That quiet stretch is the trap: it is not a slow trickle with small pauses, it is one
# stall mid-frame — the width layer measuring what the frame is about to print
# (AS-BUILT-tui.md) — so a settle shorter than it photographs the tear no matter how it is
# spelled. A first attempt at 0.6s did, and so did a quiescence test with a 0.25s window. The
# stall itself was 0.88s when this was written and is 0.20s since disp_fits bounded the
# measurement; the window is not re-tuned down, because what it is sized against is the SLOW
# machine, not this one. For scale, the list frame the 15-24ms figure in
# shell/uting:2688 describes is two orders of magnitude away from this one.
#
# So: unchanged across a 1.5s window, not a 1.5s sleep. On this machine the two would behave
# the same; they part on a slower one, where the stall grows and a fixed sleep goes back to
# photographing tears silently while a stability window simply waits longer. Same rule as the
# ready marker above — watch the thing, do not time it.
#
# The bound is a fuse, not the mechanism, and it is sized as one: settling costs at most the
# stall plus the window (0.88 + 1.5 = ~2.4s) on the worst frame measured, so 4s clears it with
# margin. It exists for the frame that CANNOT go still — a running player's clock moves once a
# second, so `-k Enter -w Playing` always spends the fuse and says so. That path is the reason
# the fuse is 4s and not the 10s a first cut used: doubling the cost of the most common
# playback drive to protect a frame that was never going to settle is the wrong trade, and
# photographing after 4s of a ticking clock is no more torn than photographing after 10s.
