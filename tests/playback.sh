# Real detached playback: the one surface whose bugs are PROCESSES, not output. Everything
# here starts real mpv players — silent (--volume 0), in a state dir of their own, and the run
# does not pass until `pgrep` comes back empty: a leaked mpv is the failure this file exists
# to catch.
#
# No gate. It used to sit behind YT_TEST_LIFECYCLE=1 because starting players meant starting
# them ON TOP OF the user's — --stop --all reached whatever they were listening to. The state
# dir below removes that, and what is left is a run that needs the network — a reason to run it
# when the player changed, not a reason for an env var to guard it.
#
# Cost, measured 2026-08-26: **62s / 42 ok**, and it is real work rather than waiting. Roughly
# 30s is seven live engine resolves (ut-play:530 records the measured median between tracks at
# 4.3s) and ~19s is the listening-log section playing a 19-second track out to its own end
# rather than seeking there — that section cannot seek, because `duration` is null on a live
# stream and a check must not go green or red on whether the fixture was streaming that
# afternoon. Neither half is reducible without a stand-in, and this file has none.
#
# EVERY WAIT HERE IS A BOUNDED POLL. There are exactly two fixed sleeps left and neither is a
# wait — both are SETUP, and both say so where they sit. Three others were `sleep 1`/`sleep 2`
# guesses at conditions the code can observe (the record empty, pgrep at zero); they became
# polls on 2026-08-26, which took the run from 68s to 62s. Speed was the smaller half: a fixed
# guess also goes red when the machine is merely slow, and a red that is not a bug still costs
# somebody an investigation.
#
# And it carries the one claim that needs a SECOND source: that the player applies the
# http_headers an engine hands it. See the Bilibili section for why only that site can show it.
#
# It also owns the LIVE READ (--status off the mpv socket), for the same reason: the peer is
# real mpv or it is nothing. The suite keeps no stand-in for a component, so a claim about
# talking to mpv can only be made where mpv is running — which is here, and only here.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2. Needs jq for the envelopes; no tmux and no terminal — every
# assertion here is an exit code or a field out of a real envelope.
