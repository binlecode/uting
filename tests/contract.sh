# The CLI contract, asserted by RUNNING it. No rig: a command-line tool is tested by
# invoking it and reading its exit code and its stdout, which is all this file does.
#
# What it covers: the search envelope's shape, every documented rejection (a flag on the
# wrong verb, a bare query where a URL belongs, two actions at once, a selector with no
# action), the read-only --transcript verb both ways, the idle lifecycle, the tombstone
# record for a player that died unasked, --version, the non-TTY refusal, the failure
# taxonomy — 1 is usage, 2 is a tool that failed, and the two engines' envelopes agreeing
# key for key — and the documented PIPELINES between commands, run rather than printed
# (AS-BUILT-cli-contract.md「调用面」; the one that launches a player is playback.sh's).
#
# This replaced a skill that carried the same commands as prose for an agent to copy out by
# hand. That version rotted silently: it listed a resident socket server as a check (it hangs
# and asserts nothing), asserted the same exit code in two phases, described the network path
# in a sentence with no command behind it, referenced capture files that were never made, and
# had no coverage at all for --transcript. A test suite that cannot be executed reports green
# by default, which is worse than having none.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 (macOS system bash). No bash-4 idioms; see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md「可移植性契约」.
#
# Cost, measured 2026-09-01 and broken down because a number at the door is what a reader
# decides on: ~55-65s in full (runs minutes apart came back 55s, 60s, 63s and 64s — the live half is
# roughly 21 engine round trips and the spread is the sites'), of which `--offline` is the
# first ~20s: 224 of the 322 checks, no packet sent. That 20 is dominated by one deliberate
# 5.5s lock spin — a FRESH held lock has to be waited out, that being what the spin is for;
# the stale-lock steal beside it costs 0.1s because staleness is tested before the spin, not
# after (shell/ut-playlist:lock_playlist).
#
# Per-SECTION figures are deliberately absent: this file's output is block-buffered the moment
# it is piped or redirected, so timestamping its section headers dates the flush, not the work.
# The two totals above are wall-clock around the whole command, which is the only shape of
# this measurement that survives being taken.
#
# Numbers in this paragraph have been wrong before, three at once — ~80s for the full run,
# "one 5s lock spin" where three were paid, "~25s of tmux" for 4s of it — which is its own
# lesson: a cost comment is a claim, and this file's rule is that a claim gets executed, not
# read.
# It starts no process it did not have to and talks to no peer — every live claim is
# tests/playback.sh's.
# The TUI section is the near-exception and is held to the same line: the process there is a
# real `uting` on a real tty, it is CHECKED to leave no player behind, and the EXIT trap reaps
# one if it ever does.
#
# Usage:  tests/contract.sh            all checks
#         tests/contract.sh --offline  the hermetic half only — every gate, both stores, the
#                                      lifecycle and the death record, and no packet sent
# Exit:   0 = every check held, 1 = at least one regression

# --offline exists because CLAUDE.md asks for this file on ANY change at all, including a

# ---- the player's state dir, pointed somewhere disposable ---------------------------
# THE ARGUMENT FOR THIS LIVES HERE, and the other two files under tests/ point at it rather
# than restating it. ARCHITECTURE.md「风险登记」 carries the one-line risk row; this is its why.
#
# `ut-play` derives its state dir from TMPDIR ("${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/uting-$(id -u)", shell/ut-play)
# and takes no override of its own. Left at the user's real TMPDIR, this file --stop --all's a
# player they are listening to, writes its tombstone fixtures into their real players/, and
# rm -rf's their real failure record — three side effects on live user state, in a suite whose
# instruction is "run it before every commit".
#
# Redirecting TMPDIR is what makes that instruction safe. It changes nothing about WHAT is
# invoked or asserted: the player is the real one and its state is really written, just not on
# top of the user's. The playlist store already had this in UT_STATE_DIR; the half that kills
# processes is the half that needed it more.
UT_TEST_TMP=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/uting-contract.XXXXXX") || exit 1
export TMPDIR="$UT_TEST_TMP"
STATE_DIR="$TMPDIR/uting-$(id -u)"

# ---- the config file, pointed somewhere disposable ----------------------------------
# The same argument as TMPDIR above, one layer out. Every command in the suite now reads
# ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/uting/config, so without this line a developer whose real
# config sets UT_MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS or UT_SORT_FIELD would see this file go red on their
# machine and green on everyone else's — the worst failure a suite can have, because the
# red is not in the subject. It points at a real, EMPTY file rather than a missing path so
# the loader's read path is the one exercised for the rest of the run; the checks that
# prove the loader actually loads something write their own file and set UT_CONFIG
# themselves.
export UT_CONFIG="$UT_TEST_TMP/config"
: > "$UT_CONFIG"

# ---- …and the real one, WATCHED --------------------------------------------------------
# The export above redirects every command this shell runs. It does not reach a tmux pane —
# a new session inherits the tmux SERVER's environment, not this shell's, which is why the
# TUI section passes its own knobs explicitly — and it does not reach whatever a future check
# forks in a way nobody predicted here. That gap used to be harmless because nothing in the
# suite WROTE a config; uting now writes six preference keys back to the user's file, so an
# unisolated caller does not merely read a developer's config, it edits it, and the value it
# leaves is one they never chose.
#
# Two fingerprints around the whole run catch ANY such caller, including one added long after
# this line was written — which is exactly what three call sites each remembering to export
# cannot do. cksum rather than a timestamp: it is POSIX (macOS `stat` and GNU `stat` do not
# share a format string), and the claim is that the file's CONTENT is the one the user left.

# ---- …and the real STATE DIR, watched the same way ------------------------------------
# The config file got this guard when uting learned to write one. The playlist store and the
# listening log have been writable by every check in this file since long before that, and
# they had no guard at all — the discipline was three sections each remembering to point
# UT_STATE_DIR somewhere disposable, which is exactly the kind of discipline that holds until
# it doesn't. It didn't: a section added after the one that ends with `unset UT_STATE_DIR`
# assigned the variable without exporting it, and every ut-playlist call in it went to the
# user's real store and left a playlist there.
#
# So the same two fingerprints the config gets, around the same run, over the whole state
# tree. `ls -R` piped through cksum rather than the files' contents: what must not change is
# WHICH lists and logs exist, and a real listening session running in another window will
# legitimately grow today's .jsonl while this file runs. A name appearing or vanishing is the
# shape a leak takes, and it is the shape this catches.

# ---- the offline half, FIRST -------------------------------------------------------
# Everything below this line to the live-fixture preamble runs without a network: flag gates,
# the idle lifecycle, the death-record fixtures, the two halves of the user-level store,
# --version, and the host allowlist. It used to sit AFTER ~15 live engine round trips, so the
# most common regression of all — a gate or an envelope broken by the edit you are about to
# commit — cost 80 seconds to see. Measured 2026-08-26: the gates are red at 1s, the idle
# lifecycle at 1s, the death record at 2s, and the whole offline half is done at 14s with no
# network call made. 5.5s of that is the playlist store's deliberate spin against a live
# holder, so a gate regression is still seen in about two seconds.
#
# It is also a HALF you can run on its own, which is the point of --offline: the boundary was
# already load-bearing, and a boundary nobody can stop at is a boundary only the author uses.
#
# THE ORDER IS PART OF THE FILE, not an accident of how it grew:
#   · offline first, so a broken gate is red before anything is fetched;
#   · the death-record fixtures ahead of the TUI section (stated again at that section, where
#     the mechanism is) — the pane's `uting` polls --status once a second and every lifecycle
#     verb reaps, so a fixture created after the pane is up can be deleted before the
#     assertion that reads it;
#   · the TUI section LAST, for the same reason from the other side.
# Moving a section is therefore a deliberate act. Nothing here reads a live fixture — that is
# what made the move a permutation rather than a rewrite, and it is what keeps it one.

# A live engine call costs a yt-dlp start (~2s) whether one question is asked of its answer
# or four, and nearly every assertion below is about an envelope's SHAPE. Two identical
# queries cannot answer a shape question differently, so each fixture is fetched once and
# interrogated as many times as it has claims. The command is still the real entry point and
# the answer is still its real stdout.
#
# A call keeps its own invocation when its ARGV differs (-j and -J are two envelopes, not two
# questions about one), when its ENVIRONMENT differs (the proxy checks), or when its INPUT
# differs (a second query, chosen for content the first one does not have).
#
# AND THEY ALL GO OUT TOGETHER. Twenty-odd of these calls have no dependency on each other —
# they ask different engines different questions — and run one after another they were most
# of this file's wall clock: ~70s of a ~130s run, spent waiting on a network that was idle
# between calls. They are fired as background jobs and collected once; the assertions below
