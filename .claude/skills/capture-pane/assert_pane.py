"""Assert uting's layout invariants against a captured pane.

Several rigs merged into one, because they all read the same capture and all failed the same
way when kept apart — you fix a renderer, remember to re-run two of the three, and the third
goes stale. There is one view left to check: the `card` branch went when the second renderer
did, and a mode nothing can produce is a mode that quietly passes. The checks:

  pane width   No drawn line exceeds the pane. This is the one that catches the width layer
               getting something wrong, and it is measured in CELLS (east_asian_width), not
               characters, because a CJK title is two cells and a naive len() would pass a
               line that visibly wraps.

  index column Every result row's title starts on the SAME cell, whether the row is selected
               ("> ") or not, 1-digit index or 2-digit. The prefixes used to be per-row
               literals, so a page that reached two digits started every 1-digit title one
               cell to the left — ragged in the one column the eye scans down.

  rail column  Every result row's duration rail is right-flush at one column, and the
               progress bar ends on the same one. That column is the pane width minus the
               scrollbar gutter and its cell of air, so it is MEASURED rather than assumed —
               the renderer derives every right-hand flush from one expression, and this
               asserts they agree with each other, which stays true when the gutter's width
               changes (█ and │ are Ambiguous: two cells under YT_AMBIG_WIDE).

  gutter       Every result row ends with a scrollbar cell, all in the same column, and a
               list longer than its window shows BOTH glyphs — all thumb or all track means
               the thumb was never sized.
               A capture is the terminal's own cell grid, so this measures where the rail was
               actually DRAWN — which is the whole point: char_w over-counts on purpose, so a
               rail placed by computed padding lands early on rows the terminal drew narrower
               than we measured. Placing it with CHA is what makes this pass.


  playing row  Given a SECOND capture taken with `tmux capture-pane -pe` (--sgr <file>), the
               row the player is on carries the reverse attribute from cell 1 to the pane
               width — the whole line, including the stretch the rail's CHA jumps over
               without writing. This is the one invariant a plain `-p` capture is
               structurally blind to: `-p` throws every SGR away, so a row highlighted only
               as far as its title looks identical to a correct one. The check is here and
               not in tests/ for the reason every other check here is: this is layout, and
               the suites assert survival, not shape.

               A window the playing row has scrolled out of is a real frame too — the cursor
               is the user's and the window follows the cursor, so nothing is highlighted and
               nothing scrolls back. Say so with --off-window, and the check REVERSES rather
               than switching off: it then asserts that no row is reversed. Both states are
               asserted; neither flag turns the check into a no-op.

Captures come from `tmux capture-pane -p` — which is what the capture-pane skill feeds this, and the
only source now that the pty rigs are gone. Ambiguous-width characters count as ONE cell, matching the suite's default
(YT_AMBIG_WIDE unset); pass --ambig-wide to match the other setting.
