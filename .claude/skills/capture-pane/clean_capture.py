"""Clean a raw `tmux capture-pane -p` frame of uting into a block ready to paste
VERBATIM into a Markdown fence.

Usage:
    tmux capture-pane -t SESSION -p > tmp/raw.txt
    python3 clean_capture.py tmp/raw.txt > tmp/list.txt

What it does:
  - right-trims every line (tmux pads each row out to the pane width),
  - drops trailing blank rows (the unused bottom of the pane),
  - drops a leading fetch line (`searching "…"…`) and its spinner glyph,
  - refuses (exit 2) a capture that still looks mid-fetch, because a spinner frame
    pasted into a doc is a diagram of the loading state, not of the layout.

What it deliberately does NOT do: measure widths. Cell measurement lives in
this skill's assert_pane.py and must not exist twice — run that on the cleaned file before
splicing it into a doc. It also never removes an interior row: every row of a list
frame is load-bearing (the index column, the right-flush duration rail and the
details block are all mutually aligned), so a "compressed" frame is a torn frame.
